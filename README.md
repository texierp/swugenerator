## Description

`swugenerator` is a tool running on host to create and modify SWUpdate's Update
files (SWU). SWU file contains a meta description of the release (`sw-description`), 
and swugenerator adds components to a template passed from command line.
This tool requires *openssl* to run and to sign the SWU. It is goal of the tool to fill
the gap with Yocto/OE, where SWU generation is done by classes in the meta-swupdate layer,
but other buildsystems like Debian or Buildroot have no tools to create a SWU.

The tool signs the SWU and can encrypt the artifacts. The tool parses the libconf based sw-description (tool does not work for JSON based sw-description) and provides the following features:

    - replace occurrencies of variables found in the CONFIG file
    - add sha256 to each artifact
    - check if an artifact should be encrypted and encrypts it
    - sign sw-description with one of the methods accepted by SWUpdate
    - pack all artifacts into a SWU file
